**Just a fun way to pick a name.**

I built this little app for me and my friends because we couldn't decide on a name for our account. Instead of arguing in group chat, I thought it would be funny to make a "Thunderdome" style voting arena.

## Why?

We needed a fair way to rank our ideas. Polls are boring, but 1v1 battles are fun.

So I built this:
1. **The Matches**: It picks two random names. You pick the winner.
2. **The Math**: It uses an **Elo rating system** (like in Chess) to rank them.
3. **The Prank**: I added a fake "Security Deposit" screen to charge my friends $20 just to vote. (Don't worry, it's a joke).

## How it works
It's a simple Next.js app connected to Firebase so we can all vote at the same time and see the leaderboard update live.

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind (Midnight Luxury theme because why not?)
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Vibe**: Serious business (but actually just for fun)
